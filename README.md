## Abstract
Grassland species are one of the most severely declining groups of birds, largely due to historical habitat loss which has incurred extinction debts. Beyond direct habitat manipulations (e.g., prescribed fire), conservation efforts for grassland birds often take a landscape perspective, particularly when making decisions about acquiring reserves and allocating management efforts among existing reserves. Additionally, climate is increasingly recognized as a critical consideration for grassland bird conservation, since precipitation has a strong effect on habitat structure and grassland habitats generally experience less microclimate buffering compared to forested habitats. Here, we used a 15-year monitoring dataset of breeding bird surveys from the highest-quality patches of remaining grassland habitat in Minnesota, USA, to 1) estimate occurrence trends for 33 species that use grasslands and 2) assess the influence of three traditional landscape factors (reserve size, reserve shape, and amount of open habitat) and one climate factor (precipitation anomaly) on baseline occurrence and trends. Our model revealed declines across the grassland bird community, including for 7 out of 8 grassland obligate species and 3 out of the 25 facultative grassland species. The traditional landscape variables were associated with baseline occurrence of relatively few species (e.g., amount of open habitat showed a clear relationship with baseline occurrence of 3 species, all obligates) and buffered declines for only a handful of species (e.g., amount of open habitat showed a clear buffering effect for only two species, Bobolink and Red-winged Blackbird). In contrast, breeding-season precipitation anomaly showed clear relationships with baseline occurrence for 15 species (with a nearly even mix of positive and negative effects); however, effects on trends were few (wetter conditions buffered declines for Field and Savannah Sparrows but accelerated declines for Dickcissels). Considered holistically, our results indicate that grassland bird declines are apparent even in the highest-quality remaining habitats. Landscape factors may have limited capacity to buffer against grassland bird declines in the future, especially as precipitation anomalies have a larger impact on population trajectories and climate conditions continue to change.
